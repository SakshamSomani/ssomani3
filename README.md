This repository is a portfolio of projects I've completed for self learning and at University of Illinois Chicago. 
 

## Data Analysis with Python & SQL

### [Clustering: Strategic New Fitness Centers in Los Angeles](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/Data_analysis_project/Strategic-New-Fitness-Centers-LA/Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb)

The overall goal is to minimize travel for all Los Angeles residents in need of access to a local gym while promoting health across the city. The objective of this project in particular is to determine optimal locations for a new gym or fitness center within Los Angeles. Specifically, the end result is to compile a list of Los Angeles neighborhoods that have no gyms or fitness centers within 3000 meters from their center points.

  ## DATA Mining Project: Data Mining with R 

### [Recommender System: Champo Carpet](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20Using%20R/HW5_Sol.Rmd)
This was a collaborative project between 3 students at UIC. The main object of this project wat to improve the sale of Champo Carpets using Machine Learning Algorithms and provide a recommender system. Classification algorithms like decision tree, random forest, Multi logistic regression, neural network were successfully impletmented using R.
Data Methodology:
  + Data Gathering
  + Data Visualization: Exploratory Data ANalysis
  + Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
  + CLassification Modeling using decision tree, random forest, Multi logistic regression, nueral network
  + Development of Recommender system

  ## Machine Learning Algorithms 

### [ML Algorithms]( https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/tree/main/machine_learning)
This folder contains a few Pythons scripts for different Machine Learning Algorithms which I have implemented for my IDS 575: Machine Learning and Statistical Methods Course at University of Illinois.

+ [K Nearest Neighbor]( https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/machine_learning/k_Nearest_Neighborhood.ipynb)
+ [Linear Regression and Gradient Descent]( https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/machine_learning/Linear_Regression_and_Gradient_Descent.ipynb)
+ [Logistics Regression and Binary Classification]( https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/machine_learning/Logistic_Regression_and_Binary_Classification.ipynb)

 ## Advanced Database Management: School Management System Using SQL 

### [DBMS: Database & Queries](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/tree/main/SQL_School_Management_System)
This project is a basic understanding of Database Management of a School/University using MySQL server. This sytem was developed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Masters of Science in Business Analytics Degree (MSBA) by the collaborative effort of 3 UIC students. 

#### Databases:  Departments | Buildings | Subjects | Teachers | Advisors | Sections

#### Query Operations: Create | Insert | Select | Group by | Where | Join (Inner, Outer, Natutral) | Order by
