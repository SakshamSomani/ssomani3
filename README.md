### [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/tree/main/Data_analysis_project/Movie%20Recommender%20System)

A recommendation system or recommendation engine is a model used for information filtering where it tries to predict the preferences of a user and provide suggestions based on these preferences. These systems have become increasingly popular nowadays and are widely used today in areas such as movies, music, books, videos, clothing, restaurants, food, places, and other utilities. These systems collect information about a user's preferences and behavior, then use this information to improve their suggestions in the future.
A team of 4 students at the University of Illinois created a Pyspark based movie recommender system using Content Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering.

Methodology:
  + Data Gathering ( Movielens 25M Dataset) 
  + Popularity Based Filtering
  + Item Based Filtering
  + Collaborative Filtering using Alternating Least Squares

### [Stellar Classification](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/tree/main/machine_learning/Stellar%20Classification)

In this project, we are classifying celestial bodies observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) into Stars, Galaxies, and Quasars. The sky is filled with several celestial bodies that we observe daily. All of them have their own unique characteristics. We analyzed these characteristics to find the most important and differentiating characteristics in order to effectively classify stars, galaxies and quasars.


Methodology:
  + Data Gathering ( Sloan Digital Sky Survey from Kaggle) 
  + Exploratory Data Analysis
  + Univariate and Multivariate Analysis
  + Data Preparation
  + Machine Learning Models 
    * KNN | Logistic Regression | SGD CLassifier | Support Vector Machine | Decision Tree Classifier | Random Forest | Gradient Boosting Classifier | Extremely Randomized Trees
  + Cross Validation
  + Hyperparameter Tuning
  
  
## Data Analysis with Python & SQL

### [Clustering: Strategic New Fitness Centers in Los Angeles](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/Data_analysis_project/Strategic-New-Fitness-Centers-LA/Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb)

The overall goal is to minimize travel for all Los Angeles residents in need of access to a local gym while promoting health across the city. The objective of this project in particular is to determine optimal locations for a new gym or fitness center within Los Angeles. Specifically, the end result is to compile a list of Los Angeles neighborhoods that have no gyms or fitness centers within 3000 meters from their center points.

Methodology:
  + Data Gathering
  + Geocoding LA Neighborhoods
  + Data Visualization: Mapping Los Angeles
  + Exploring Neighborhood Venues With Foursquare API
  + Clustering Neighborhoods by Gym & Fitness Center Data

### [Recommender System: Champo Carpet](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20Using%20R/HW5_Sol.Rmd)
This was a collaborative project between 3 students at UIC. The main object of this project wat to improve the sale of Champo Carpets using Machine Learning Algorithms and provide a recommender system. Classification algorithms like decision tree, random forest, Multi logistic regression, neural network were successfully impletmented using R.
Methodology:
  + Data Gathering
  + Data Visualization: Exploratory Data ANalysis
  + Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
  + CLassification Modeling using decision tree, random forest, Multi logistic regression, nueral network
  + Development of Recommender system

 ## Advanced Database Management: School Management System Using SQL 

### [DBMS: Database & Queries](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/tree/main/SQL_School_Management_System)
This project is a basic understanding of Database Management of a School/University using MySQL server. This sytem was developed in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Masters of Science in Business Analytics Degree (MSBA) by the collaborative effort of 3 UIC students. 

#### Databases:  Departments | Buildings | Subjects | Teachers | Advisors | Sections

#### Query Operations: Create | Insert | Select | Group by | Where | Join (Inner, Outer, Natutral) | Order by
