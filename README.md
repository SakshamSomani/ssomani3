### [Clustering: Strategic New Fitness Centers in Los Angeles](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/Data_analysis_project/Strategic-New-Fitness-Centers-LA/Data_Analysis_Project.ipynb)

The overall goal is to minimize travel for all Los Angeles residents in need of access to a local gym while promoting health across the city. The objective of this project in particular is to determine optimal locations for a new gym or fitness center within Los Angeles. Specifically, the end result is to compile a list of Los Angeles neighborhoods that have no gyms or fitness centers within 3000 meters from their center points.

Data Methodology:
  + Data Gathering
  + Geocoding LA Neighborhoods
  + Data Visualization: Mapping Los Angeles
  + Exploring Neighborhood Venues With Foursquare API
  + Clustering Neighborhoods by Gym & Fitness Center Data

  ## DATA Mining Project: Data Mining with R 

### [Recommender System: Champo Carpet](https://github.com/SakshamSomani/ssomani3/blob/main/Data%20Mining%20Using%20R/HW5_Sol.Rmd)
This was a collaborative project between 3 students at UIC. The main object of this project wat to improve the sale of CHampo Carpets using Machine Learning Algorithms and provide a recommender System. Classification algorithms like decision tree, random forest, Multi logistic regression, nueral network were successfully impletmented using R.
Data Methodology:
  + Data Gathering
  + Data Visualization: Exploratory Data ANalysis
  + Data Cleaning and Pre=processing
  + CLassification Modeling using decision tree, random forest, Multi logistic regression, nueral network
  + Development of Recommender system
